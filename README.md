# Rust Matrix

This is a simple project that I'm making to try and familiarize myself with the Rust language. The plan is to support nearly all of the matrix operations that are necessary for an entry-level linear algebra course.

# To-Do List
- QR Decomposition
- QR Algorithm for Eigenvalues
- Make the class generic for number formats other than f64
- More detailed tests for current methods
- More to come...
