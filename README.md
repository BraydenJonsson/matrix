# Rust Matrix

This is a simple project that I'm making to try and familiarize myself with the Rust language. The plan is to support nearly all of the matrix operations that are necessary for an entry-level linear algebra course.

Feel free to use this code however you please, no guarantees about functionality, usability, etc.
